##Introduction:

This is a `ionic-timepicker` bower component which can be used with any Ionic framework's application.

[View Demo](http://rajeshwarpatlolla.github.io/TimePickerForIonicFramework/demo/ "Demo") 

##Prerequisites.

1) node.js, bower and gulp.

##How to use:

1) In your project repository install the ionic time picker using bower

bower install ionic-timepicker --save-dev

2) Then you can see the following directory structure see in your project folder

![Directory Structure](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_s2lFLFfgYSUfhdmZO0r4w6td80dEErTN4pLc7Louo8=w200-h300-p-no "Directory Structure")

Give the path of  `style.css, templates.js and ionic-timepicker.js` in your `index.html` file.

````html
<link href="lib/ionic-timepicker/dist/style.css" rel="stylesheet">

<!-- path to ionic/angularjs js -->
<script src="lib/ionic-timepicker/dist/templates.js"></script>
<script src="lib/ionic-timepicker/dist/ionic-timepicker.js"></script>
````    

3) In your application module inject the dependency `ionic-timepicker`, in order to work with the ionic time picker

````javascript
angular.module('modulename', ['ionic', 'ionic-timepicker']){

}
````

4) Use the below format in your template's corresponding controller

````javascript
$scope.slots = {epochTime: 12600, format: 12, step: 15};

$scope.timePickerCallback = function (val) {
  if (typeof (val) === 'undefined') {
    console.log('Time not selected');
  } else {
    console.log('Selected time is : ', val);	// `val` will contain the selected time in epoch
  }
};
````

a) `timePickerCallback` is the callback function which we have to pass to the `ionic-timepicker` directive.

5) Then use the below format in your template / html file

````html
<ionic-timepicker etime="slots.epochTime" format="slots.format" step="slots.step" callback="timePickerCallback">    
<button class="button button-block button-positive"> {{slots.epochTime}} </button>
</ionic-timepicker>
````


a) `ionic-timepicker` is the directive, to which we can pass required vales.

b) `etime` takes epoch time, which will be converted to UTC.

c) `format` indicates 12 hour or 24 hour format. It can take two values, 12 or 24.

d) `step` indicates minute increment. It can take two values, 1 or 15.

e) `callback` is the callback function, which will be called once the timepicker popup has bees closed. It will return `undefined` if no time has been selected. It will return the `time in epoch` if the user selects some time.

You can also use any of my [directives](https://github.com/rajeshwarpatlolla/my-angularjs-directives) to convert the epoch time to string format.

Tested with `angular#1.3.6` and `ionic#1.0.0-beta.14`. 

6) To integrate with [ionic-datepicker](https://github.com/rajeshwarpatlolla/ionic-datepicker "ionic-datepicker") and call timePicker programmatically, see below

````javascript
$scope.slots = $rootScope.$new(true);
//If you're using underscorejs
_.extend($scope.slots, {epochTime: 12600, format: 24, step: 15});
//Without underscorejs
$scope.slots.epochTime = 12600;
$scope.slots.format = 24;
$scope.slots.step = 15;

$scope.datePickerCallback = function (val) {
    if(typeof(val)==='undefined'){      
        console.log('Date not selected');
    }else{
        showTimePicker($scope.slots, $ionicPopup);
        console.log('Selected date is : ', val);
    }
};
````
